# Left Ventricle Segmentation

This repository contains code and resources for performing left ventricle (LV) segmentation based on the preprocessing techniques discussed in the article [Preprocessing the Image Dataset for Left Ventricle Segmentation](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2023/04/preprocessing-the-image-dataset-for-left-ventricle-segmentation/) from Analytics Vidhya.

## Introduction
Left ventricle segmentation is a critical task in medical imaging, particularly in the analysis of cardiac MRI and CT scans. This project implements preprocessing techniques to prepare image datasets for effective segmentation.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of medical images of the left ventricle. Ensure that you have the necessary permissions and licenses to use this dataset.

## Preprocessing Steps
The preprocessing steps outlined in the referenced article include:
1. **Data Loading**: Load the images from the dataset.
2. **Image Normalization**: Normalize the images to enhance contrast and prepare them for segmentation.
3. **Resizing**: Resize images to a consistent dimension for model training.
4. **Augmentation**: Apply data augmentation techniques to increase the robustness of the model.

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the following packages:

```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib
```

## Usage
To execute the preprocessing script, run the following command:

```bash
python preprocess.py
```

Make sure to adjust the script as necessary for your dataset's file paths.
